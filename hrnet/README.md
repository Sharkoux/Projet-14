# Project 14: Pass a jQuery library to React

For this project, we need to move an internal web application, Hrnet, from a jquery infra to React. 

The main stages of the project are:
  - Convert the whole project to React.
  - Update style (I used styled-component).
  - Convert one of the jQuery plugins to React package and publish it to NPM (I converted the jQuery plugin managing the tables)
  - Make a LightHouse performance report of the project before and after the migration to React
